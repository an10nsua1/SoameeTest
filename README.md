### Pre-requisites

React, Axion and Cors needed.

### App work


Once the SQL Database contains at least one book, a button for each book will be deployed.
Clicking the buttons will display the details of the book in a portal, including ISBN and author's full name.
The text boxes of the book's part, correctly indicated in the page, correspond to, in order, "_name", "_isbn" and "_author" fields in the SQL Database.
As well, the text boxes of the author's part correspond to "_first_name" and "_last_name".

Pressing "Upload" we will be creating a new row in the SQL DB, while pressing "Upload" we would be update the data already inside de DB.
